Right now there is no Simulation
just spining using CL

split the PH Instance Shaders into a Base

then create a Struct for Particle data and use that for the Instance_Buffer

PolyHedra Base for the Shader ?

DepthFactors is only really needed for 3D (instead of UI)
View is also only for 3D
and ViewPortSizeRatio is for everything ?



make Wrappers for CL stuff ?



what Kernels do I need ?

InitInGrid

MoveForeward
KeepInBound
PointForeward

sometimes:
	VelTowardLine



Subject also wants Text
