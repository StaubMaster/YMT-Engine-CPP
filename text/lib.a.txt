man ld

     -lx         This option tells the linker to search for libx.dylib or libx.a in the library search path.  If string x is of the form y.o,
                 then that file is searched for in the same places, but without prepending `lib' or appending `.a' or `.dylib' to the file-
                 name.



ls -la /usr/local/lib

	...
	libglfw.dylib
	...



so -lglfw finds that file ?



just put the .a file in the lib dir ?
is that safe
some of the files in the lib dir seem to be links
so maybe make one of those
