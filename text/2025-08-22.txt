	FileWrapper
		checks if file exists
		get file extention
		ReadAllText
		Parse in a certain Format
			PNG
	FileArray

Texture Array
	takes a FileArray
	load all into GL_Texture with a certain size



allways forgot one little thing so it took a long time to do
but setting Trans3D with OpenCL works

but right now I use that data to set the Instance Shader every time which might be slow ?


also, spamming data into the terminal and looking through it is kind of annyoing
so Text might be a good Idea ?

but I should probably put everything into namespaces first
and also put some more QualityOfLife stuff ?
