	FileWrapper
		checks if file exists
		get file extention
		ReadAllText
		Parse in a certain Format
			PNG
	FileArray

Texture Array
	takes a FileArray
	load all into GL_Texture with a certain size



allways forgot one little thing so it took a long time to do
but setting Trans3D with OpenCL works

but right now I use that data to set the Instance Shader every time which might be slow ?


also, spamming data into the terminal and looking through it is kind of annyoing
so Text might be a good Idea ?

but I should probably put everything into namespaces first
and also put some more QualityOfLife stuff ?




have a header for all YMT stuff
have a header for all Abstract3D stuff

namespace

{
	YMT::Abstract3D::Point3D

	YMT::Graphics::Uniform::
	YMT::Graphics::Shader::
	YMT::Graphics::Buffer::
}

{
	"PolyHedra.hpp"
	YMT::PolyHedra
	YMT::PolyHedra::ShaderUni
	YMT::PolyHedra::BufferUni
	YMT::PolyHedra::ShaderInst
	YMT::PolyHedra::BufferInst
}

there arent any shaders that arent in Graphics
so remove that ?

{
	YMT::Uniform::
	YMT::Shader
	YMT::Buffer

	YMT::Point3D
}

but in what header should these be ?
also should the file structure resamble the namespace structure ?
