	Abstract3D
	Text
	Camera

Body Parser:

	it isnt even fully finished

stuff I dont have jet
	MultiThread

	openCL

from VoxelGL:
	Controls (Forms)
	Voxel stuff

from Older Engine:
	Spline Curve stuff



I should probably structure things before starting to just code stuff
but I dont know how to structure things until I start doing stuff
then again without all the Depracated stuff it probably isnt that much anyway
so reworking things shouldnt be that difficult ?

just start coding ?
