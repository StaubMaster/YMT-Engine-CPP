its hard for me to Implement stuff because I dont know where to start
some things are weird to port from C# to C++
and I dont want to make things worse

also some stuff already exists for the most part
like mouse centering
or at atleast locking
it allows the mose to move infinitly
but I still need to center it ?

also it consumes a lot of CPU
it was running with unlimited speed
to I made it run at 64Hz
but it still consumes a lot



stuff I still need to do
	finish Abstract3D
	Uniforms			partial
	finish PolyHedra
	Textures
	finish Shaders
	ScaleRatio			done
	DepthRatio			done



Implement something
then Clean Up

so right now Uniforms are bad
so clean those up first ?



Uniform Base up to Trans3D done
should I rename Transformation3D to Trans3D ?

how should I name things ?
should all shaders start or end with Shader ?

also should I put them into a directory called Shader ?
do I need to do both ?



do ScaleRatio for better visuals ?	done
do PolyHedra for better bodys		done (somewhat)

make Shader with Uniforms for less clutter
