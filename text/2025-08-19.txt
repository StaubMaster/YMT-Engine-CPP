still needed:
	improve Performance ?
		not sure why it takes so much CPU
	PolyHedra
		Normals
	Shader
		Text ?
		Matrixes
		Instance
		Light
		Form



Text: seems important to show info

From: might also be fun ?
	but text is part of that and seems more important

Instance:
	probably the easiest to get working
	but how should I do it

change Editable Array
	QRemove
		give each Element a variable on if it should be removed
		then remove them all at once
		so that reorganizing is done once instead of every time
	QInsert
		inserting needs to copy everything over
		when the old Memory size is full
		how would that work ?
		allocate seperate Memory
			then store Queue in there
			what if that gets full as well ?
				recursion ?
				if the Queue gets full, it makes its own Queue ?
				when the Queue is being done
				dont assable the Queues together
				just go through all of them in order
				Queue remove as well ?
		first check how much additional space is needed
	MinSize
	MaxSize
	InsertMulti
	RemoveMulti

	CopyMemory ?
		ptr0
		idx0
		prt1
		idx1
		len

	Insert at Index
		when queuing an insert
		that insert needs to change the index of the other inserts that are effacted
