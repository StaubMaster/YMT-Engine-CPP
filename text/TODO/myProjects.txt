Voxel stuff
but maybe start off with some easy 2D-Height map stuff
	Perlin Noise
	maybe mix to have Biomes
	maybe place stuff like Trees

can use that to also figure out
	Level of Detail ?
		higher Quality up close, lower when farther
	Save/Load / Generate Chunk Data





Generation:
	Diffiusion something
		cant remember the name
		where you have a grid where every tile could be everything
		but then you set one to be something
		and then the surrounding tiles have a limited selection
	Other name
		Place an Element
		the Element has connection Points
		then check what fits
		and place another Element connected to that
		and keep going like that





Spline Curves:
	I already did those
	shouldnt be too hard to implement
	I used the old version for Rails
	maybe do that again
	I think Tessalation can be used to connect things
