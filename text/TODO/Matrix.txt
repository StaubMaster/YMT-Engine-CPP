should be simple
would make things more standerdized internally
would not change things externally

dosent need anything else
probably do UniformBases before this
and then make A Uniform for Matrix3x3



right now Angle3D uses a fixed [3][3] float Array
in the OpenCL Kernal I already made a struct for them
make a DataStruct for Matrix3x3
