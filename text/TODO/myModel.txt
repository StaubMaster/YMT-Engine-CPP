all the stuff I want to do needs 3D Models
specifically Files

I already have a bunch in .polyhedra.ymt
but the format is not finished
and still kind of janky

just use .obj ?





in the past I had an Idea of having PolyHedra be abstract
so its just Corners and Faces
no Colors / Textures

I could make that
and make OBJ inherit / use that

my thaught is that I dont really need the save the whole thing
it gets assambled differently for the buffers anyway
and the only part that might be needed agains would be for intersections ?
which only needs corners and faces







Generate Models ?
	Basic:
		Cube
		Cone
		Ball
		Pyramide ?
	Complex:
		Tower ?
		Tree ?
