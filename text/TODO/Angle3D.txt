should be simple
would change things internally and externally

probably do Matrix before this



right now Angle3D need to call CalcBack of CalcFore
to calc the matrix
this is kind of irrelivant since using a Transposed Matrix does the same thing
so allways calculate the matrix the same internally
and the have rotateFore and rotateBack again

probably dont name them that
since there is also "inverted" angles
one refers to Axis Order
the other refers to having an Angle that brings a Point back to its initial point

so basically:
if I have an angle a0
an angle a1 that is the inverse of a0
and an arbitrary point p

then: a1.rotateFore(a0.rotateFore(p)) == p
and : a1.rotateBack(a0.rotateBack(p)) == p

but : a1.rotateFore(a0.rotateBack(p)) != p
and : a1.rotateBack(a0.rotateFore(p)) != p

use operators for this stuff ?
should rotating a Point be +- or */ ?
inverting should probably be -sign
there are no */ signs so +- it is
unless inverted rotation can also be done recalculating
which case operators dont work ?
they do work but there would be 4 cases to differentiante

have operators but also functions that do the same thing
rotateNormalFore
rotateInvertFore
rotateNormalBack
rotateInvertBack
maybe think of better names
