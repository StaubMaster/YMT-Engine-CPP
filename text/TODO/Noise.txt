should be simple
something new

not sure where to use it yet
maybe for Voxels but that is far away
and I would probably just do it for fun



Perlin Noise:

I made already
in VoxelGL
but it could probably be improved




Static Noise:

last time I made it I basically just calculated a hash of coordinates
the hash is 256 Bits but a standerd 32 Bits would probably be enough

for getting an actual output the value would be &ed or %ed
but then the problem is that the probability of non n^2 values are not even
