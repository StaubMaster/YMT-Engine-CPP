right now there is the main folder with a lot of things in it

and I would like the other things to be more organized



but then the paths would get long and convoluted again
like with DataStructs




how much should go into Graphics
this is a Graphics Engine so technically most things fit in there
but right now it is for the Basic Graphics stuff



/Miscellaneous
	helpful stuff that is not directly related to Graphics

/Graphics
	base / basic Graphics related stuff

/DataStruct
	basic data stuff
	some of the things are very specific
	like Light
	so just more or less simple Data stuff
	with a fixed and relatively small size
	and mostly unspecific





	Temporary:

/DataStruct/Main
	Main Data for Buffers

/DataStruct/Inst
	Instance Data for Buffers

/DataStruct/Full
	Main and Instance Data for Buffers
