probably somewhat difficult / tedious

something new



needed by Particle Simulator



in the C# there is what is basically a simple vector Text thingy
in VoxelGL there is a Texture Text thing

the interpretation of charCode to Pallet / Image Index is the same / similar

so make a Base Text Buffer / Shader
or just make one for now and then make a Base later

which one would be better
both are mostly copying with improving
so it dosent really matter ?



the main part is probably the UI scaling stuff

also the old verions recalculate the Text stuff every Frame
also use a EntryContainer system
