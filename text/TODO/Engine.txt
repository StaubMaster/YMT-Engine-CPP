should be simple
would changes things internally and externally

do before other things that require the project



rename Project
CPP- should be at the beginning
CPP-YMT-Engine maybe
or just CPP-Engine
CPP-3D-Engine
CPP-GL-Engine
rename before making other projects that include this
but basically everything I want to do includes renaming first

still mark these as YMT ?

maybe think of a different acronym
something more optimistic ?
