not sure how difficult

would change Makefile



OpenGL currently needs a few -l flags to Compile
these are hardcoded in the Examples, so where the final .exe is made

but it would much better if these were specified in the OpenGL Makefile
so the final thing dosent need to know about those flags

also maybe make something that checks for the correct flags
instead of having them hardcoded per OS






also it being GLFW dosent matter except for a few places
mainly the Window

make it so there is also a OpenGL Window. which does all he GLFW stuff
so the final Engine only needs to know the OpenGL functions. so glSomething()
