not sure how difficult

would change Makefile





make something that checks for the correct flags
instead of having them hardcoded per OS






also it being GLFW dosent matter except for a few places
mainly the Window

make it so there is also a OpenGL Window. which does all he GLFW stuff
so the final Engine only needs to know the OpenGL functions. so glSomething()
