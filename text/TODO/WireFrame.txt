probably somewhat difficult / tedious

something new


not sure where to use it yet




make a general one for PolyHedra ?
modified version of PolyHedra that uses Edges instead of Faces

everything else like texture and Normals would also not be needed



also something like AxisBox3D and Point2Point Lines would also be Wires
should those have their own Shaders
or make a WireFrame PolyHedra for them
and then get transformed to where they are needed

that would also mean that they need scaling
which isnt currently being done
but thats very simple
