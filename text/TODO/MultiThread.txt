probebly very complicated
drawing in openGL can only be done on one Thread anyway



make Windows have 2 Threads
1 that calls FrameFunc
1 that calls UpdateFunc

KeyStatus are stored and can be accesed outside of the Drawing Thread

Cursor Position could probably also be stored so it can be accessed from anythwre





the Drawing Thread stores things like KeyStates and other Input stuff
other only need to access a constant version of it

the Update Thread stores things like Instance Data
the Drawing Thread only needs to access a const version to copy into buffers


right now I dont think there is anything that is changed by multiple Threads
although later on there might be something
