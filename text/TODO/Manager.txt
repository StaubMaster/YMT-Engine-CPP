I already had the Idead of a Graphics Manager at the beginning
right now all the examples have a lot of stuff defined there

make a Manager that internally includes all that stuff

before that, figure out what stuff to up in the Manager
like all the Light stuff is pretty much done
maybe allow more spotLights
but besides that it is basically a fully functional "Module"

although there is also some other stuff that could be collected together
so a LightShader, with all the Uniforms inside
