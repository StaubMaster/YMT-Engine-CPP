put Buffers in NameSpace

before that organize / name them better


BaseBuffer can have multiple IDs
but only has one Attribute Array
it would need one Attribute Array per BufferID ?

so make that the BaseBuffer
and then a bunch of those would be a BaseBufferArray

except BaseBufferArray is currently the name of the VertexBuffer
which makes sense, since that is what stores the Buffers

so
Buffer::BaseArray
{
	Buffer::Base * Buffers;
	unsigned int BufferCount;
	BaseArray(unsigned int count);
}
Buffer::Base
{
	Base(unsigned int ID);
}
