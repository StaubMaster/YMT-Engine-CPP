probably complicated

not relly required for anything but would be nice to have



right now whenever I need to debug something I need to go through the code and add std::out everywhere
it would probably be easier to have those permanent and to just turn them on and off as needed



how would one turn them on and off ?
defines ?
that would require recompiling which is bad
it would be better if if could be turned on and off at any time

so just have a variable to turn this stuff on and off
I dont want it to take too much space

also when it is off it should not waste time assambling messages at all
