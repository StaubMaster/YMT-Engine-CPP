IntelliSense Comments
	add comments to functions to explain what they do
	at least for the functions used in the Mains



IntelliSense includes
	are kind of wacky at the moment
	probably because the includes are done with Makefile Commands
	which IntelliSense dosent understand / store ?
	it should probalby do that
	I think I can tell it somewhere but I'm not sure where
	I tried putting it in .vscode/c_cpp_properties.json
	but that didnt work
