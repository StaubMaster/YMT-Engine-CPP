not sure how difficult

not needed but changing would require updating everything that uses these
which I already did once
it wasnt that hard



basically the Names still suck
DataStruct/Main
DataStruct/Inst
DataStruct/Full

I dont really like them being in DataStruct
but I also dont want them directly in the Base Folder
basically replace DataStruct with a different Folder
but I'm not sure what to call this group

Display ?
so Graphics is the more basic stuff
while Dispaly is more complex ?
put Window and Texture in there as well

but the Instance stuff is not only Display but also just Data
