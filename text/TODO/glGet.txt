not even sure what exactly I want to do here

might be useful



glGet is a group of functions that can be used to get various internal openGL info

like the current Active Program, which I am currently storing myself
dont need to do that



it can also get Limits like for Vertex Attributes
make a check for Attributes that check if the index is above the max ?
then throw an error ?

it would at least tell when something dosent work
instead of having to figure out why



this is kind of part of the whoe Debugging thing

function that shows all Limit info
function that shows all variable info
	maybe not all but just "global" stuff
funcitons that show variable info for specific things
	like all Texture data like if it loops and such
