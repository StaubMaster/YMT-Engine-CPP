add more stuff to Debug
Debug could be its own thing ?
so another Repository ?

but it includes FileContext ?
remove that

check for FILE_CONTEXT_HPP to check if FileContext is known
then depending on that, declare all the functions that use that

how do I handle the -I Includes ?

have the repos next to eachother
in the same folder
so	./FileManager
and	./DebugLogger

that way they can all include eachother with no problem
but having a repo change things outside of itself would probably be bad
and they cant delete eachother since there should be one that remains

so use the Engien as a Center, that clones and removes the others as needed
