alraedy have in VoxelGL
will probably redo / change





create User Interface stuff
so like Forms from C#



save/load from/to File ?
for that I should first improve the File Parsing



Controls:
Form	the Base
Button	click/hold/toggle/multistate ?
Text	just show / writable ?
Slider

what does every control need ?
Control (Base)
{
	MinDist
	MaxDist
	Size

	Anchor
	Color

	Parent *
}

TextControl : Control
{
	Text
}

GroupControl : Control
{
	Children []
}


Pos/Size
each control needs 2 of MinDist/Size/MaxDist set
the other is calculated

MinDist is the distance from the top left the Parent
MaxDist is the distance from the botton right of the Parent
Size is the distance from MinDist to MaxDist

 MinDist          Size               MaxDist

		|-------|------|--------|
		 MinDist  Size   MaxDist

Min and Max makes it sound like a Box
in which case Max would be MinDist + Size

but the Dist is what describes that it is something different ?





Buffers:
I think Instances would be best ?
I need a Box, which is 2 Tris
so fill a MainBuffer with just 2 Tris
and then fill the InstBuffer with all the Control Data

InstData for Controls
{
	Pos (Center of Box)
	Scale (Size of Box / 2)
	Color
	State ?
}

State:
with the VoxelGL Controls
the Color would be directly changed in the Control Update
so changing Color when Hovering
or the Toggle state

put all the Colors in a Texture ?
then give an Index of the Color to use

they also have different colors on the edges
VoxelGL just takes the Color and makes it slightly lighter / darker
have the edge colors in Texture as well
so it is a n x 3 Texture
where y can be used to get the edge colors ?

but the smallest dataType in GLSL is uint which is 32 bits
and at that point just give the Color ?







also all this stuff would be better with the Grid stuff from the C# Engine
