some of the stuff could be put into their own Librarys ?
but I dont want to put them into their own Projects
since that would require Cloning them which would be too much for this stuff

but I still want to seperate them further then they are currently ?
right now the stuff is directly in the main folder
put them in other ?
that seems too seperated



Collective Header ?
these are usually a main thing and some related things
when I only want the main thing i use thing.hpp
but what if I want everything ?





all the Data Structs ?
	they are inherent to the "Engine"
PolyHedra
OBJ
Physics3D
