still needed:
	improve Performance
	rename things ?
		YMT_ prefix ?
		namespace ?
			ymt or YMT
			having it be lower case is Standard but do I cate ?
	PolyHedra
		Textures
		Normals
	Shader
		Matrixes
		Text ?
		Instance
		Light



Texture
	simple implementation works
	how should this be handled ?
	how should it work with PolyHedra ?
	if a PolyHedra wants a Texture,
		check if that texture is alrady loaded ?
		have a texture for a simple Color Pallet ?
	use string name ?
	or SHA256 of Image data ?



the ol' PNG Loader has some stuff that might me useful in general ?
stuff that might be helpful
	FileReader
		SaveText
		LoadText
			I redo reading the whole file into a string every time
			because C++ cant do that by iteslf ?
	uint
		uint8
		uint16
		uint32
		uint64
		so I dont have to do "unsigned int" every time
	DataStream
		rename to ByteStream
		reads from data, one Byte at a time
		kind of like TextLoop ?
		maybe change so it can read larger values ?
		not sure if its even used
