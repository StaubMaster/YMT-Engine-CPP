I think I dont need to do Point3D
because Vector3 already exists somewhere
but it does slightly other stuff then what I want


do the Matixes already exist somewhere
or should I make them myself as well ?



should I make the Uniform that know their own Type
or should I make the Objects themselves know how to do their Uniforms
like <<



also what do I do now
	Abstract3D
	Window
	Uniforms
	PolyHedra
	Textures



what else should go into Graphics
	ScreenRatio
	DepthRatio
	Camera ?
		here or Abstract3D ?
		probably here
		or next to Window ?
	Uniforms ?
		depends how I want to Implement these
	should Shader / Buffer have their own Dir ?
	should Abstract3D have a Header ?
		so you can include that to get all the stuff

I think doing Window would be the most helpful
	use that to get some Wrappers so things dont need to be so convoluted
