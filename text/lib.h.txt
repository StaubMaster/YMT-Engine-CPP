GLFW/glfw3.h is in E:\Utility\glfw-3.4.bin.WIN64\include

copy/link file into one of these dirs ?
no
Mac has a user include
have it link to a user include directory
put stuff there ?
or just link directly to the GLFW include ?
that might result in it having to look through a lot of paths if I add more stuff
but not sure if I ever will add more stuff
