once again go back to FloatN ?

at least for the simple stuff
like Point3D
which in Data is the same as Color
both are Float3

and DepthFactors is an Array of Floats
same as Range
both are Float1

but GenericUniformBase wants a Data type
so make FloatNArray Data Types

then the more complex stuff gets turned into these



the reason I am thinking about this is because Intensity in Light
is literally just a Float, there isnt really a metter descriptor for this
but if I ust low descriptors then why not use Float3 ?
why not use Float1 for DepthFactors
