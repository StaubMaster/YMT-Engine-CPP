not sure if material is even required

how to texture ?
if i dont get texture coords I need to generate them
it says the texture should not be stretched on any of the sides
but it shows an image where the texture is on one side but is stretched on the perpendicular side
although its not really a "stretch" and instead just the same ?
also for something like the teapot, how do I make it now stretched ?



how to color ?
can I just have an order, that colors the Faces as:
[(i % 4) + 0] = color[0]
[(i % 4) + 1] = color[1]
[(i % 4) + 2] = color[2]
[(i % 4) + 3] = color[3]
but this might cause 2 faces that are next to each other to have the same color
but again, the picture seemd to use the simple version ?

a "real" version would:
give the first face the first color
then go to the next face, check what colors the neightbours have
and then pick the lowest unused color
can this result in a case where there is no free color ?
no (if there are only triangles)
	if I have 4 colors
	the 3 neightbours all have different colors
	and the current gets the last color
should a quad have one color ?
in the pictures it seem so
of I need the highest order Polygon + 1 Colors
