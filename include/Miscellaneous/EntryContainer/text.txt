current problem
how do Entrys work ?
have them in the EntryContainer
and return a Pointer ?
maybe a referance

but when the Container gets deleted, the Pointers become undefined
need to make sure that dosent happen

also right now all the functions, ported from C#, are kind of ugly
will need to organize those
