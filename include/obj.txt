PolyHedra:
Load OBJ File
	go line by line
	ignore empty lines
	#	Comment
	v	Position
	vt	Texture
	vn	Normal
		these are not per Corner, they are stored seperatly
	f
		v1			v2 			v3
		v1/vt1		v2/vt2		v3/vt3
		v1/vt1/vn1	v2/vt2/vn2	v3/vt3/vn3
		v1//vn1		v2//vn2		v3//vn3
		here the prev things are combined
		these are Index Based, Indexes start at 1 not 0
	ignore everything else for now
	should these be converted to PolyHedra
	or store as its own thing
	in FileManager
	then convert to PolyHedra ? or directly to _MainData ?



how to parse
I dont feel like doing a signle string parser
also this is a "one command per line" format
so instead

extract lines
remove comments
check if just whitespace

split into command and arguments





dont ignore everything else
the material stuff is also supposed to be done
so make a function to convert to PolyHedra
or change PolyHedra to be more complex
and/or make a new MainData and Buffer and Shader for OBJ
