rename Abstract to Data ?
is that less or more vague ?

should all the Data stuff be put into one Folder ?
instead of seperate by Dimension ?
also should the PointN be renamed to FloatN ?
same with IndexN and UndexN to IntN and UIntN ?
nah





MakeFile
currenly sucks
at home the Archives and Librarys are different
there is a way to make the MakeFile check those ?





there are also aparently a lot of things that openGL / glfw has already implemented
something about light, maybe projection stuff

but creating things myself gives me more freedom ?
	like with Depth, I like to use Relative Distance instead of DepthFactors
	since that means the same Depth when Spining
	although that might also be doable with Factors
	or at least outside the Fragment Shader





also maybe start working on the Projects
loading .obj should be simple compared to the .ymt I've already done

openCL dosent currently work because of the Links (on Mac)
but besides that I already have ComputeShaders and Instances
so that that done as well

Voxel I also already have but that Project needs a Partner :(









also maybe look for a job.
