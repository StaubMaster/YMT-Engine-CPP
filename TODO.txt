Angle
right now Angle is just 3 Angles along with sin and cos
what to do with those values (foreward/backward) is decided by what uses it
the sin cos is stored because I think recalculating those thenever the Angle is used would be inefficient
so my Idea is
have a AngleBase class that stores the 3 Angles and a rotation matrix
it dosent calculate the matrix
then inherit AngleFore and AngleBack
these automatically calculate their appropriate matrix
no Idea how easy it is to rotate angles / invert angles is with this





rename Abstract to Data ?
is that less or more vague ?

should all the Data stuff be put into one Folder ?
instead of seperate by Dimension ?
also should the PointN be renamed to FloatN ?
same with IndexN and UndexN to IntN and UIntN ?
nah





MakeFile
currenly sucks
at home the Archives and Librarys are different
there is a way to make the MakeFile check those ?





there are also aparently a lot of things that openGL / glfw has already implemented
something about light, maybe projection stuff

but creating things myself gives me more freedom ?
	like with Depth, I like to use Relative Distance instead of DepthFactors
	since that means the same Depth when Spining
	although that might also be doable with Factors
	or at least outside the Fragment Shader





also maybe start working on the Projects
loading .obj should be simple compared to the .ymt I've already done

openCL dosent currently work because of the Links (on Mac)
but besides that I already have ComputeShaders and Instances
so that that done as well

Voxel I also already have but that Project needs a Partner :(









also maybe look for a job.
