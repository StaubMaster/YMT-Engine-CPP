	Uniforms can be generalized to FloatN and IntN
	(and whatever other data types are needed in the future)
	but storing FloatN is vague
	so allow for all DataTypes to converted into these simples
	and then use those for simple Uniforms
	do the same for Attributes

	more comlex stuff can also be generalized to some degree
	like Ray3D and AxisBox3D both being made of 2 Point3D s
	but first do normal FloatN





WireFrame
	would be best as its own thing like PolyHedra
	so a full class probably just called WireFrame

Display Collection Thing Types
	PolyHedra, OBJ and the theoretical WireFrame
	they do similar things
	a Collection of Data that
	that is then used as Main Data
	"DisplayObject"
Instance Data
	there is also Instance Data
	currently Simple3D and Physics3D
	I dont want them in the base Folder
	put them together with the DisplayObjects ?

	right now PH_3D is in PH
	but it should probably also be its own thing
	BufferArray and associated Shader

	EntryBuffer (currently PolyHedra_3D_Instances, dont like the name)
	also still havent made EntryBufferArray, not sure if i even need that one



optimize compilation
	foreward declaration
		<iosfwd> in header instead of <iostream>





MakeFile
currenly sucks
at home the Archives and Librarys are different
there is a way to make the MakeFile check those ?





there are also aparently a lot of things that openGL / glfw has already implemented
something about light, maybe projection stuff

but creating things myself gives me more freedom ?
	like with Depth, I like to use Relative Distance instead of DepthFactors
	since that means the same Depth when Spining
	although that might also be doable with Factors
	or at least outside the Fragment Shader





also maybe start working on the Projects
loading .obj should be simple compared to the .ymt I've already done

openCL dosent currently work because of the Links (on Mac)
but besides that I already have ComputeShaders and Instances
so that that done as well

Voxel I also already have but that Project needs a Partner :(









also maybe look for a job.
