reorganize Files

rename Abstract to Data ?
is that less or more vague ?

need to rename the new Uniform stuff to Uniform and Multiform
remove old Uniform stuff
should all the Data stuff be put into one Folder ?
instead of seperate by Dimension ?
also should the PointN be renamed to FloatN ?
same with IndexN and UndexN to IntN and UIntN ?
nah

should I put the Uni and Multi in their respective Class as a nested Class ?
pretty use Classes in C++ are all the like parial classes in C#
so if you include a Header that adds more stuff onto a Class, that dosent conflict with anything already there
then it just adds on





FileManager

class FileContext
{
	bool Exists();
	Image * LoadImage();
} similar to FileInfo in C#

class Image
{
	FromBMP();
	FromPNG();
}

put this stuff into its own Repo
not sure where else I might use this
but on GitHub it would look better to have a bunch of different things
instead of one thing that can do a bunch of stuff
maybe the Sixel thing ?

make ZLIB its own thing ?
not its own Repo
but its own sub thing of the FileManager
implementing the rest would probably suck
but might look good ?







Shaders take an Array of ShaderCode
make ShaderCode use FileContext
use params ShaderCode[]



there are also aparently a lot of things that openGL / glfw has already implemented
something about light, maybe projection stuff

but creating things myself gives me more freedom ?
	like with Depth, I like to use Relative Distance instead of DepthFactors
	since that means the same Depth when Spining
	although that might also be doable with Factors
	or at least outside the Fragment Shader





MakeFile
currenly sucks
at home the Archives and Librarys are different
there is a way to make the MakeFile check those ?





also maybe start working on the Projects
loading .obj should be simple compared to the .ymt I've already done

openCL dosent currently work because of the Links (on Mac)
but besides that I already have ComputeShaders and Instances
so that that done as well

Voxel I also already have but that Project needs a Partner :(









also maybe look for a job.
