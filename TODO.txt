store KeyStates from Callback in Window
since openGL only gives down



/examples are very coplex at this point
put them into their own project
keep the examples here simple






42 Projects:
OBJ_Parser and Particle Simulator
put into their own projects / the 42 repos
maybe register first so people can where you're wasting your time
they would mostly just download this repo
should be fine since I wrote everything myself





unrelated:
	put the chrome extensions into a repo
	maybe give it a ui so the parts can be turned on and off
	stop doing it with a timer



IntelliSense Comments
	add comments to functions to explain what they do
	at least for the functions used in the Mains




organize
	Uniforms can be generalized to FloatN and IntN
	(and whatever other data types are needed in the future)
	but storing FloatN is vague
	so allow for all DataTypes to converted into these simples
	and then use those for simple Uniforms
	do the same for Attributes
	more comlex stuff can also be generalized to some degree
	like Ray3D and AxisBox3D both being made of 2 Point3D s
	but first do normal FloatN





WireFrame
	would be best as its own thing like PolyHedra
	so a full class probably just called WireFrame

Display Collection Thing Types
	PolyHedra, OBJ and the theoretical WireFrame
	they do similar things
	a Collection of Data that
	that is then used as Main Data
	"DisplayObject"
Instance Data
	there is also Instance Data
	currently Simple3D and Physics3D
	I dont want them in the base Folder
	put them together with the DisplayObjects ?

	right now PH_3D is in PH
	but it should probably also be its own thing
	BufferArray and associated Shader

	EntryBuffer (currently PolyHedra_3D_Instances, dont like the name)
	also still havent made EntryBufferArray, not sure if i even need that one
